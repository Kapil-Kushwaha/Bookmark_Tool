# üìñ Semantic Bookmark Manager

A web application for managing bookmarks with semantic search capabilities. Traditional bookmark managers can become disorganized and difficult to navigate as they grow. Unlike a categorical approach, this tool eliminates the need to organize bookmarks manually, simplifying the user experience.

It is a simple Flask app with minimal CSS and JavaScript, quick to set up and easy to use. Features focus only on quickly adding and retrieving bookmarks.

3. Set up your configuration:
   - For local Ollama setup:
     - Ensure [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) is installed and running on your machine
     - Configure Ollama to accept external connections (if the app and Ollama are running on different machines):
       ```
       export OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0

     - Obtain [Google API credentials](https://ai.google.dev/) and set them up in the configuration

    - Start the Flask application:
        ```
        python app.py
        ```
    - Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`
    - Use the configuration page to set up your preferred AI service (Ollama or Google Gemini)

## üîó API Integration

The application provides API endpoints for integration with other tools. Details are below:
- **POST** `/api/search````
Request format:
{
    "query": "search query string",
    "page": 1,  // optional, default is 1

    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]  // optional, filter by tags
}

Returns:
{
    "results": [
        {
            "link": "bookmark url",
            "summary": "bookmark summary",
            "base_url": "base url of the bookmark",
            "timestamp": "bookmark creation timestamp",
            "similarity": float,  // similarity score
            "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]  // tags associated with the bookmark
        },
        ...
    ],
